# Python_Conway-s_Game_of_Life
This is a Python version of the famous Game of Life by British mathematician John Horton Conway. Created using the Python tkinker library. The initial pattern is already generated (10 3x3 squares randomly distributed around the canvas). I'm currently working on user interaction via mouse click to create their own initial pattern.
